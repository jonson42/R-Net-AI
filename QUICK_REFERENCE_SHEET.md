## 📈 Real-World ROI Example

### Development Agency (10 Projects/Month)

**Before R-Net AI:**
- Setup: 2 days per project × 10 = 20 days
- Developer cost: $75/hr × 160 hours = **$12,000**

**After R-Net AI:**
- Setup: 2 hours per project × 10 = 20 hours
- Developer cost: $75/hr × 20 hours = $1,500
- API cost: $1.50 × 10 = $15
- **Total: $1,515**

**Savings: $10,485/month = $125,820/year**

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Should You Use R-Net AI?

**✅ YES - If you:**
- Build multiple similar applications
- Need fast time-to-market
- Want consistent baseline code
- Have budget constraints
- Build standard web apps (CRUD, dashboards)

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Try It** - Generate 2-3 sample projects (30 minutes)
2. **Evaluate** - Review code quality and fit (1 hour)
3. **Plan** - Decide which projects to use it for (1 hour)
4. **Train** - Teach team best practices (2 hours)
5. **Implement** - Start with low-risk project (1 week)
6. **Scale** - Roll out to appropriate projects (ongoing)

---

## 📝 Bottom Line

**R-Net AI is a productivity multiplier**, not a developer replacement.

**Best Use:** Intelligent scaffolding that handles tedious setup, enforces best practices, and provides a solid foundation.

**Success Formula:** AI generates structure → Developers add business logic → Review → Deploy

**The Key:** Use for appropriate projects, establish review processes, measure results, iterate.
