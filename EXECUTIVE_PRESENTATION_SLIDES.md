## SLIDE 6: ROI - The Numbers

### Development Agency Example (10 projects/month)

**Traditional Approach:**
- Setup time: 2 days per project × 10 = 20 days
- Developer cost: $75/hour × 160 hours = **$12,000/month**

**With R-Net AI:**
- Setup time: 2 hours per project × 10 = 20 hours
- Developer cost: $75/hour × 20 hours = $1,500
- API cost: 10 × $1.50 = $15
- **Total: $1,515/month**

### 💰 Monthly Savings: $10,485
### 📈 Annual Savings: $125,820
### 🎯 ROI: 827% return

### **Questions?**

---

## APPENDIX: FAQ

**Q: Is the generated code production-ready?**  
A: Yes, but like any code, it should be reviewed. Treat it as high-quality junior developer output.

**Q: What if I don't like the generated code?**  
A: Regenerate with a more detailed prompt, or use it as a starting point and customize.

**Q: Can it replace developers?**  
A: No. It's a productivity tool that handles setup, freeing developers for complex business logic.

**Q: What about code ownership/licensing?**  
A: Generated code is yours. Review OpenAI's terms of service for specifics.

**Q: How secure is the generated code?**  
A: Includes JWT auth, bcrypt hashing, input validation, and security headers. Security review still recommended.

**Q: Can it integrate with our existing codebase?**  
A: Best for new projects. For existing codebases, generate components separately and integrate manually.

**Q: What if OpenAI changes their API?**  
A: Backend abstracts OpenAI API, making updates easier. We'll maintain compatibility.

**Q: Do we need to share our mockups with OpenAI?**  
A: Yes, images are sent to OpenAI for analysis. Review their privacy policy. Use non-sensitive designs for testing.
