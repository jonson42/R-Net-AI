## Best Practices for Prompts

### 1. Be Specific About Functionality
Instead of: "Create a web app"
Use: "Create a task management web application with user authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, and real-time updates"

### 2. Include Technical Requirements
- Specify frameworks and technologies
- Mention security requirements
- Include performance considerations
- Request specific integrations

### 3. Describe User Experience
- Responsive design requirements
- Accessibility considerations
- User interaction patterns
- Error handling expectations

### 4. Mention Testing and Documentation
- Request unit tests for critical functions
- Ask for API documentation
- Include setup instructions
- Specify deployment requirements

### 5. Consider Scalability and Maintenance
- Database optimization needs
- Caching strategies
- Monitoring and logging
- Configuration management
